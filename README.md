## Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a GeoFormer that simultaneously enhances the global geometric structure of the points and improves the local details. Specifically, we design a **CCM Feature Enhanced Point Generator** to integrate image features from multi-view consistent canonical coordinate maps (CCMs) and align them with pure point features, thereby enhancing the global geometry feature. Additionally, we employ the **Multi-scale Geometry-aware Upsampler** module to progressively enhance local details. This is achieved through cross attention between the multi-scale features extracted from the partial input and the features derived from previously estimated points.
